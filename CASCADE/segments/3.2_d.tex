\begin{frame}{Stages of the Waterfall method}
    \begin{block}{Limitations}
        \item It Relies heavily on detailed upfront planning, which can result in missed requirements if the planning is not thorough enough
        \item Because it is build in sequential order that means a that some features have to be build before others so it can take some time to go from one step to another
        \item This method does not allow for significant changes to be made once a stage is completed, making it inflexible, which can be a disadvantage in dynamic environments.
        \item Because it relies heavily on detailed upfront planning, it can result in missed requirements if the planning is not thorough enough from the beginning 
        \item Testing and debugging are not integrated into the process until the later stages of the project, making it more difficult to identify and fix problems early on.
