   \subsection{Introduction}

   \item The Waterfall methodology, also known as Waterfall model, is a method used in project management with a linear and sequential approach.

   \item Like its name indicates, it flows like a waterfall through all phases of a project, meaning that each phase has a distinct endpoint and is completely wrapped up before the next one begins.

   \item After their completion, a phase can't be revisited.


   \subsection{Histoire}

   \item The first detailed diagram of this process was introduced by Winston Walker Royce in 1970.

   \item However, the term "Waterfall" was not used at that time. Its first use had been in 1976 in a paper by Bell and Thayer.
