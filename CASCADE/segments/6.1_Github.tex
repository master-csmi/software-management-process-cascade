    \begin{block}{The process of the method using Github}
        - Implementation: Github will be used to manage the codebase during this stage by setting up a repository for the project

        - Testing: setting up distinct branches in Github for various test cases and to fix issues and bugs.

        - Deployment: Github will be used to manage the deployment process by creating a release branch, which contains the final version of the code that is ready for deployment.

        - Maintenance: Github will create separate branches for different maintenance tasks and using pull requests to review and merge the changes into the main codebase.
