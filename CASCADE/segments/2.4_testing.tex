        - Involves evaluating the software to ensure it meets requirements and functions as expected
        
        - Various types of testing performed, including:
            
            \hspace*{10mm}• Unit Testing: individual component testing
            
            \hspace*{10mm}• Integration Testing: multiple component integration testing
            
            \hspace*{10mm}• System Testing: full system testing
            
            \hspace*{10mm}• User Acceptance Testing: testing with actual users
        
        - Helps to ensure the quality and reliability of the final product
        
        - Identifies and resolves any issues or bugs in the code
        
        - Results used to make any necessary changes before deployment
        
        - A successful testing phase is a key indicator that the software is ready for release.
